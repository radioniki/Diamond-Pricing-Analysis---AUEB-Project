<h1>Diamond Pricing Analysis </h1>
</div>
This repository contains a detailed statistical study on the pricing of diamonds, conducted as part of an academic project at the Athens University of Economics and Business.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze the factors that influence the price of diamonds using a dataset of 308 observations. The analysis takes into account variables such as carat weight, color, clarity, and certification organization. The study applies various statistical techniques, including descriptive analysis, predictive models, and hypothesis testing, to explore relationships between these variables and diamond pricing.

🔐 **Key Sections:** 

Introduction - Overview of the problem and dataset.

Descriptive Analysis - Statistical descriptions and visualizations of the variables.

Bivariate Relationships - Examination of relationships between variables.

Predictive Models - Construction of models to predict diamond prices based on the key factors.

Conclusions - Discussion of findings and implications for the diamond trade.

🧰**Tools Used:**

R for statistical analysis and data visualization.

Statistical Methods: Hypothesis testing, regression models, and non-parametric tests.
